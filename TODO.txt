- Have two modes, one that only records info about imports, and
  one that actually rewrites a file to fill in missing ones.

- Add an option to send the rewritten file to stdout. This way
  mr.igor can be used as a filter command in editors.

- Smarter heuristics for where in the file to insert the imports
  (e.g. should be after initial docstrings/comments)
